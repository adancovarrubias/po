  		<h1>Imagin A World</h1>
  		<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eQJCrQJUPJrWimxn_bZt4w.jpeg">
			<p>Imagine a world where you are able to achieve just about anything — where you are able to reach your goals every time. Even as other people around you fail repeatedly, you glide through life and accomplish magnificent things. Imagine a world where you succeed repeatedly and the only catch is that you have to give up one thing.</p>
			<p>Imagine owning a business or supporting yourself with passive income or sharing your art with the world on a daily basis. All your dreams can be yours if only you give up one thing.</p>
			<p>Your bank balance will rise. You will affect great change in the world in an absolutely beautiful and positive way.</p>
			<p>You will inspire others and improve the lives of every person around you. Your relationships will be stronger, your values solidified, your inner confidence will soar. And you only have to give up one thing.</p>
			<p>But don’t worry. You’ll be happy to give it up. You’ll be happy to let it go. Your life will be forever changed for the better.</p>
			<p>Do you want to know what it is?</p>
			<p>I’m not religious. But when I was younger, I was raised in the Catholic Church. I didn’t like it. But one thing about Catholics is that every year for about 6 weeks, they give up one thing for a period called “Lent.” The idea is that you give up one thing as a sacrifice. Most of the time, us kids gave up things like sweets or our favorite kind of soda.</p>
			<p>Other religions and cultures have their own versions of fasting, renunciation and personal sacrifice. </p>
			<p>But this thing I’m talking about, this thing you’ll have to give up in order to succeed — it’s not like candy bars or soda pop. It won’t feel like a sacrifice. It will feel like growing wings.</p>
			<p>You won’t miss this thing you’re about to give up. You’ll wonder why you ever tolerated it for so long. It’s an easy thing to do without. Do you know what it is yet? Do you know what you’ll have to give up in order to succeed?</p>
			<p>Frustration.</p>
			<p>That’s it. That’s the little thorn in our side holding us back. We indulge in frustration. It’s killing our dreams and making us quit the things we love the most.</p>
			<p>When something isn’t working, we allow frustration to set in. We think it’s some sort of valid sign — a signal from the universe. It’s not. Frustration is an indulgent, self-centered excuse for extinguishing effort. It’s a practice in feeling sorry for ourselves. Let’s not do that. Let’s not give power and validation to frustration. We need to let it slide off us without ever touching our soul.</p>
			<p>Can you do that? Can you give up frustration?</p>
			<p>It’s important if you want to succeed. Most people don’t know this trick. They have no idea when frustration is setting in. They swim in that emotion and give it validation. And when they give power and momentum to being frustrated, they quit.</p>
			<p>But not us. Now that we know about the dangers of frustration, we no longer have to indulge in it. We’re done stopping half-way or letting difficulties stop us. Try it this week. No matter what happens, let frustration blow through you like a strong wind. Don’t pick it up. Don’t internalize it even for a second. Don’t complain or explain why you have the right to be frustrated. Let it blow past.</p>
			<p>It is no more.</p>
			<p>Let there be no such thing as frustration in your life from this point on. There are only successful moments and stuff in between. We don’t get emotional about the stuff in between. It’s only dirt on the road that we are fortunate enough to walk.</p>
